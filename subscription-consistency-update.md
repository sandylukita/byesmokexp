# Subscription Popup Consistency Update

## Problem
The Dashboard screen had navigation-based subscription popup while the Profile screen had a local modal. This created inconsistent user experience.

## Solution
Updated Dashboard screen to use the same local modal approach as Profile screen for consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. DashboardScreen.tsx Updates:

#### Imports Added:
- Added `Modal` to React Native imports
- Added `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS` and `handleSubscription` from subscription service

#### State Added:
- `subscriptionModalVisible` state to control modal visibility

#### Functions Updated:
- `handleNavigateToSubscription()`: Now opens modal instead of navigating
- Added `handleSubscriptionSelect()`: Handles subscription plan selection

#### UI Components Added:
- Added subscription modal component identical to Profile screen
- Modal includes:
  - Plan selection cards with pricing
  - Popular badge for recommended plans
  - Feature lists for each plan
  - Cancel button

#### Cleanup:
- Removed navigation import and usage
- Modal approach is self-contained

### 2. Modal Styles Added:
- `modalOverlay`: Semi-transparent background
- `subscriptionModalContainer`: Main modal container with shadow
- `subscriptionPlan`: Individual plan cards
- `popularBadge`: Popular plan indicator
- `planHeader`, `planName`, `planPrice`, `planDuration`: Plan details
- `planFeatures`, `planFeature`: Feature lists

## Result
Both Dashboard and Profile screens now use identical local modal for subscription upgrades:

1. **Consistent UX**: Same modal design and behavior across pages
2. **Better Performance**: No navigation overhead
3. **Unified Experience**: Users see same subscription interface everywhere

## Testing
- Modal opens when clicking upgrade buttons
- Plans display correctly with pricing and features
- Modal closes on cancel or plan selection
- Subscription handling works via service layer
- TypeScript compilation passes (ignoring pre-existing project issues)

The subscription popup experience is now consistent between Dashboard and Profile pages.
