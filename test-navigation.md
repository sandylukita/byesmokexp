# Testing Navigation Changes

## Changes Made:
1. Added `useNavigation` import to DashboardScreen.tsx
2. Added `navigation` hook inside the DashboardScreen component
3. Created `handleNavigateToSubscription` function that navigates to the Subscription screen
4. Added `onPress={handleNavigateToSubscription}` to two buttons:
   - "Upgrade Premium" button in the missions section (line 1225-1230)
   - "Aktifkan Personal Motivator" button in the motivator section (line 1256-1261)

## Expected Behavior:
When users click either of these buttons:
1. The app should navigate to the SubscriptionScreen modal
2. Users can select subscription plans and payment methods
3. The modal has proper close functionality
4. User ID is passed to the subscription screen for processing

## Navigation Flow:
Dashboard → (Button Click) → SubscriptionScreen Modal → (Close) → Back to Dashboard

## Files Modified:
- src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx (main changes)
- src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx (fixed display name warnings)

## Verification:
- TypeScript compilation passes (with pre-existing warnings unrelated to our changes)
- Navigation structure is properly set up in MainNavigator.tsx
- SubscriptionScreen is already implemented and configured
