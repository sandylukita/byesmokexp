# Bento-Style Grid Layout Implementation

## Plan
Convert the current vertical card-based DashboardScreen layout into a modern bento-style grid system that provides better visual hierarchy and utilizes screen space more efficiently.

## Current Layout Analysis

### Existing Components Structure:
1. **Header** (LinearGradient) - Greeting + Logout button
2. **Level & Badge Card** - Level info, progress bar, badge display
3. **Statistics Card** - Streak, Total Days, Money Saved (3 columns)
4. **Check-in Button** - Large prominent button
5. **Daily Missions Card** - Mission list with upgrade button
6. **Motivation Card** - Daily motivation text with premium lock

### Content Organization Assessment:
- **Primary Actions**: Check-in button (most important)
- **Key Stats**: Streak, Total Days, Money Saved (high visibility needed)
- **Progress Info**: Level, XP, Badge (medium importance)
- **Engagement**: Daily missions, motivation (supporting content)
- **Navigation**: Header with greeting and logout (persistent)

## Bento Grid Layout Design

### Optimal Grid Structure for Mobile:
**2x4 Grid Layout** (2 columns, 4 rows of varying heights)

```
[     Header (Full Width)     ]
[   Stats   ] [  Check-in    ]
[   Stats   ] [  Check-in    ]
[  Level &  ] [   Daily      ]
[  Progress ] [  Missions    ]
[  Motivation (Full Width)   ]
```

### Specific Grid Recommendations:

#### **Row 1: Header (Full Width)**
- **Size**: 2x1 (spans both columns)
- **Content**: Greeting + Logout button (unchanged)
- **Rationale**: Maintains navigation consistency

#### **Row 2-3: Stats + Check-in (Split Layout)**
- **Left Column (1x2)**: Combined Statistics Card
  - **Size**: 1x2 (tall card)
  - **Content**: Streak, Total Days, Money Saved in vertical stack
  - **Design**: Larger icons, stacked layout for better readability
- **Right Column (1x2)**: Check-in Button
  - **Size**: 1x2 (tall, prominent)
  - **Content**: Large check-in button with status
  - **Design**: Maintains importance as primary action

#### **Row 4: Level + Daily Missions (Split Layout)**
- **Left Column (1x1)**: Level & Progress
  - **Size**: 1x1 (compact square)
  - **Content**: Level, XP progress, current badge
  - **Design**: Condensed layout with circular progress indicator
- **Right Column (1x1)**: Daily Missions Preview
  - **Size**: 1x1 (compact square)
  - **Content**: Mission count, next reward, upgrade button
  - **Design**: Summary view with expandable action

#### **Row 5: Motivation (Full Width)**
- **Size**: 2x1 (spans both columns)
- **Content**: Daily motivation with premium lock
- **Rationale**: Inspirational content gets full attention

### Benefits of Bento Layout:

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Check-in button gets prominent position
