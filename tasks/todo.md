## üö® CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Building

### 1. Replace Placeholder AdMob IDs
**File:** [app.json:82-84](../app.json#L82-L84)

Current (PLACEHOLDER - MUST FIX):
```json
"androidAppId": "ca-app-pub-9522080569647318~1234567890",
"iosAppId": "ca-app-pub-9522080569647318~0987654321"

- [ ] Replace the ~1234567890 and ~0987654321 with real IDs in app.json

### 2. Set Up Production Environment Variables
**File:** [src/config/environment.ts](../src/config/environment.ts)

The app uses environment variables for sensitive data. Create a `.env` file or configure via EAS Secrets:

**Required Environment Variables:**
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` - From Firebase Console
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` - From Firebase Console
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - From Firebase Console
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - From Firebase Console

eas secret:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY --value "your-key-here" --scope project
# ... repeat for all variables
```

### 3. Verify Production Configuration
**File:** [src/config/environment.ts:144-160](../src/config/environment.ts#L144-L160)

### 4. Update Version Numbers
**Files:** [app.json](../app.json), [package.json](../package.json)

**2. Gemini AI Configuration** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Currently using **mock responses** at `src/utils/geminiOptimizer.ts:357-360`
- [ ] Decision: Enable real Gemini API OR keep mocks with clear user messaging
- [ ] If enabling real API: Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set
- [ ] If keeping mocks: Update UI to indicate "simulated coaching"
- [ ] Verify monthly cost cap ($5/month) is appropriate

**3. Testing Requirements**
- [ ] Test daily bonus rewards reset at midnight (wait until next day OR test with device time change)
- [ ] Test all 3 bonus rewards work:
  - [ ] XP Boost (+50 XP)
  - [ ] Community Rankings (navigates to BadgeStats ‚Üí Community tab)
  - [ ] Streak Freeze (adds protection token)
- [ ] Test dark mode on all screens (tiles, text, icons visible)
- [ ] Test with real AdMob ads (not test ads):

  - [ ] Rewarded ads grant correct rewards
  - [ ] Frequency capping works (not too intrusive)

**4. Demo Account for App Store Review**
- [ ] Verify sandy@zaynstudio.app account has:
  - [ ] Pre-populated progress data
  - [ ] Premium upgrade button works (for testing premium features)
  - [ ] Access to all features for reviewer testing
- [ ] Document demo account credentials for App Store reviewer notes

**5. Environment Variables Checklist**
Verify ALL production environment variables are set via EAS secrets:
```bash
# Required for production
eas secret:list --scope project
```
Should show:
- [ ] EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
- [ ] EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
- [ ] EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
- [ ] EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET

- Bonus rewards unlock status stored locally (AsyncStorage) - won't sync across devices
- Community Rankings navigation requires BadgeStatisticsScreen to accept `initialTab` param (‚úÖ implemented)

**8. Post-Launch Monitoring Plan**
