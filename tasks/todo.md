## Debug sandy@mail.com Statistics Issue

### Analysis
After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several issues with how demo users' statistics (missions and badges) are being persisted:

1. **User Type Confusion**: The app supports both demo users (stored in memory/AsyncStorage) and Firebase users. The user sandy@mail.com appears to be a demo user.

2. **Mission Completion Issue**: When a mission is completed for a demo user, the `completeMission` function in `gamification.ts` tries to update Firebase, which fails for demo users since they don't exist in Firebase.

3. **State Not Persisting**: The `demoUpdateUser` function is not being called when missions are completed, so the completed missions array is not saved to AsyncStorage.

4. **Badge Award Issue**: The `checkAndAwardBadges` function also tries to update Firebase, which fails for demo users.

### Todo Items

- [ ] Check if sandy@mail.com is a demo user by searching in the demoAuth.ts DEMO_USERS array
- [ ] Create a demo-specific version of completeMission that updates demo users properly
- [ ] Create a demo-specific version of checkAndAwardBadges that updates demo users properly  
- [ ] Update DashboardScreen to use demo update functions when the user is a demo user
- [ ] Ensure completed missions and badges are properly saved to AsyncStorage for demo users
- [ ] Test the fix by completing missions and checking if they persist after app restart

### Plan
1. First, I'll verify if sandy@mail.com exists in the demo users array
2. Create new functions `demoCompleteMission` and `demoCheckAndAwardBadges` in demoAuth.ts
3. Update DashboardScreen to detect if a user is a demo user and use the appropriate functions
4. Ensure all state updates are properly persisted to AsyncStorage

This approach will maintain separation between demo and Firebase users while ensuring both have properly functioning statistics persistence.
